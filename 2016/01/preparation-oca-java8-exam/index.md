Also I have used Mock exams [Enthuware JA+ V8 for Oracle Certified Associate - Java SE8 Programmer I](http://enthuware.com/index.php/mock-exams/oracle-certified-associate/java-oca-certification-8)

You can view examples for preparation on GitHub repository <https://github.com/XandrCherepanov/OCAJavaPrep>

## Preparation plan

I have divided all topics to six big parts. I studied each topic by reading appropriate chapters in books, passing tests in those books, and answering objective-wise tests from the Enthuware mock exams. While learning it's better to take notes about any subtle things and code examples for better understanding of the material. After completing all chapters I passed 7 full mock exams. I have scored approximately 95 percents in mock exams.
